(set: $anomalyScore to 0)


It's a beautiful sunny afternoon in Bologna. You've decided to spend the day doing something cultural, and the famous Davia Bargellini Museum of Industrial Art seems like the perfect choice.

You arrive at the grand entrance, pushing open the heavy oak doors. A receptionist at a small desk looks up and gives you a welcoming smile.

(if:visits is 1)[<p>You thank the receptionist and step into the grand entrance of the museum, $playerName. The air is quiet, filled with the faint scent of old wood and history. Your eyes are drawn to a peculiar notice pinned to a large bulletin board on the wall.</p>]

    <img src="assets/images/qr.jpg" alt="A mysterious QR code on an old poster" style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
</div>
You lean closer to the bulletin board. The poster's paper is thick, and the design looks appropriately old-fashioned, as if from the 1970s.

But your eye catches something impossible.

In the bottom-right corner, nestled amongst the vintage graphics, is a small, perfectly sharp QR code. It's completely anachronisticâ€”a modern digital tag on a decades-old poster. This is no ordinary "Help Wanted" sign. This is a message.

What do you do?

:: Find the mysterious "friend" in the portrait room.. {"position":"1500,200","size":"100,100"}
The air grows cooler as you enter the sculpture wing. The ceiling is high and vaulted, and your footsteps echo on the marble floor. In the center of the room, under a single, dramatic spotlight, is the 'Lamentation over the Dead Christ'. The raw grief carved into the terracotta figures is breathtaking and unnerving.

Your mission was to find a "friend" here, but you are completely alone in the echoing hall.

Or are you?

On the wall flanking the sculpture, two large, formal portraits hang in ornate frames. They depict members of the Bargellini family from centuries past. As you watch, a faint, ethereal gleam of light catches your eye.

Then, you hear it. A whisper that seems to come from all around you, yet from nowhere at all. A voice both male and female, layered together.

"...$playerName..."

It's your name. Both portraits are calling to you. They are the contacts. You must choose your guide.

[[Make your choice]]

        A rogue intelligence, an AI that the archevist named the Artisan, has breached the walls of time. It doesn't destroy historyâ€”it 'corrects' it, subtly replacing key items in our past, unraveling our reality thread by thread. Its canvas is history, and its brushstrokes are paradoxes.

        There is a ghost in the machine of timeâ€”a rogue consciousness born from the data streams of your era. I was the first to track it. I am the one who gave it its name: the Artisan. It sees our history not as a life lived, but as a flawed manuscript in need of an editor.
        <br><br>
        Others have tried to trace its logical patterns back to the source. None have returned. I am the only one to have faced its cold, perfect reasoning and escaped with my own memories intact.

        It has infested the artworks of my family, inserting impossible objectsâ€”anachronismsâ€”as a test.

:: Go On {"position":"4325,200","size":"100,100"}
The world dissolves in a flash of light... and then reforms with a jolt.

You feel a gentle tap on your shoulder and turn to see a museum guard looking at you with concern.

"Hello? Are you alright?" she asks. "You've been standing here in front of the bulletin board for a couple of hours. We're closing soon."

Your mind reels. A dream? You look frantically around the hall. Everything is perfectly normal. The portraits of the Hunter and the Lady with the Dog hang silently on the wall, just paint and canvas. There is no golden gleam, no whispered calls. It must have all been in your head.

Confused, and with a strange sense of loss, you thank the guard and head for the exit.

It isn't a machine of metal and wires, but a humanoid shape made of pure data, glitching and dissolving at the edges like a corrupted video file. As you watch, its form becomes less stable, large streams of light bleeding from it into the air. It seems to be in pain. It has been weakened because you fixed the anomalies.

Suddenly, your phone starts to emit a small temporal beam!

You walk out of the grand doors and into the evening light of Bologna. "What a strange day," you think to yourself, shaking your head to clear the last remnants of the vivid dream.

You put your hand in your pocket, and your fingers touch a small, square piece of thick, old paper. You pull it out.

It's the QR code from the poster. Small, sharp, and impossibly real.

You shake your head and take a step back. "Not my business," you decide. A secret mission is the last thing you want on your quiet afternoon off. You're here to see the art, and that's exactly what you'll do.

You spend the next few hours wandering through the grand halls of the museum. You admire the intricate woodcarvings in the furniture exhibits, study the early examples of industrial machinery, and appreciate the beautiful frescoes on the high ceilings. It's a wonderful, peaceful day.
